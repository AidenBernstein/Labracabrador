process: 
import labrador and tophat photos into photoshop, then use the select and mask tool to create a mask of the subject.
move the mask to a layer of pure white, then put a layer below it that is black.
for the tophat I added a band using the brush on the mask layer.
import the black and white labrador and tophat photos into illustrator and use image trace black and white logo.
for the tophat, I only made the white parts visible, then had to add the band in black and group those together.
arrange, and export to a .png (labracabrador logo tilt hat.png).
convert .png to .ico.

reasoning:
One night I was thinking that this website needs a name and I wanted it to be a pun about media, so I googled "puns." I found a few funny puns, but nothing was media related. At some point, I came across the labracabrador pun ("What do you call a magicians dog? A labracabrador!"), and that pun was stuck in my head for the next hour, so I just had to make that the website name. 
After deciding the name, I figured I would need a logo, so I tried looking online for a labrador wearing a tophat, but couldn;t find any images of that. So I decided to make my own. I can't draw so I got some free use images of a labrador and tophat, then used illustrator and photoshop to make the logo.
